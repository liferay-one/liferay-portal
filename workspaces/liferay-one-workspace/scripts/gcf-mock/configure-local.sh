# Points liferay-one-etc-spring-boot at the liferay-one-gcf-mock client
# extension.
#
# The mock is a client extension, so the normal workspace flow builds and
# deploys it. Two things still have to be arranged locally.
#
# The two overrides that redirect the DataOps calls at the mock go in
# .env.local. That is the channel the one-deploy skill documents: it is read
# after build/local.env, so it wins. docker-compose.yaml lists it as a second
# env_file, and the LEC staging appends it onto the staged <name>.env, so it
# applies in both environments.
#
# A service in docker-compose.override.yaml is needed only for docker compose,
# which does not run container client extensions at all -- no kong service
# exists there either. In k3s the recipe deploys any directory carrying an
# LCP.json, so nothing extra is required.
#
# Both files are gitignored and already honored by the workspace, so nothing
# tracked is modified. Both edits are idempotent and preserve existing content.
#
# Usage: ./configure-local.sh [--remove]

# The two environments reach the mock under different names. Docker compose uses
# the service key from docker-compose.override.yaml, while the workspace build
# rewrites LCP.json's __PROJECT_ID__ to the client extension name with the
# dashes stripped, and the k3s recipe names the Deployment and Service after
# that id -- the same reason the other pods are liferayoneetcspringboot rather
# than liferay-one-etc-spring-boot.
