# Bind the local development virtual host to the One site's public layout set so
# the site is served at its own domain root (http://one.localhost) instead of
# only at the /web/one friendly URL path. Serving the site at a domain root is
# what makes site-level redirects behave as they do in a real deployment, which
# localhost cannot exercise. The site initializer format has no virtual host
# field, so the binding is applied here as a bootstrap step that runs after the
# site initializer has created the site. The call is idempotent -- re-running it
# just re-asserts the same hostname -- so it is safe on every bootstrap and env
# reset.

# Each entry below is "siteExternalReferenceCode virtualHostname". Keep sorted.
